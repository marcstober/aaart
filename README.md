# Another ASCCII Art program

The purpose of this program, as distinguished from any other ASCII art program,
is that it's an educational program to teach how to use command-line tools.
It's not coincidental that the command-line structure/syntax is
similar to that of git (i.e., `program command --opt -o file.abc`).
It's to help learners learn that type of tool.

The image command is trying to give output similar to https://github.com/khrome/ascii-art (in JavaScript).

The text command is a wrapper around pyfiglet.

## Installing

NOTE: This package currently not open source or published publicly (i.e., on PyPI).

```powershell
pip install path/to/aaart-version.whl
```

Replace the path and filename with that of the actual wheel file.

## Building

Using `uv`:

```powershell
# in the directory where the pyproject.toml file is
uv build
```

## Testing

### Smoke test for developers

```powershell
# in the directory where the pyproject.toml file is
pip install -e .
aaart image .\tests\logo.gif
```

Run automated tests:

```powershell
pytest
```

## TODO

-   Add an Open Source license (first, think about if there are any issues with this?).
-   Publish to PyPi.
-   Support HEIC and maybe even SVG files (and potentially other formats).
