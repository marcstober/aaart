# Installing

NOTE: This package currently not open source or published publicly (i.e., on PyPI).
(If it were, we'd need to rename or namespace it as there actually is another project
named aart.)

```powershell
pip install path/to/aart-version.whl
```

Replace the path and filename with that of the actual wheel file.

# Building

Using `uv`:

```powershell
# in the directory where the pyproject.toml file is
uv build
```

# Testing

## Smoke test for developers

```powershell
# in the directory where the pyproject.toml file is
pip install -e .
aart .\examples\example-logo.gif
```

Run automated tests:

```powershell
pytest
